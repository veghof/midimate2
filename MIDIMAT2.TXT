If you, like me, have some MIDI-modules and a master-keyboard, you 
are  probably sick  and tired of having to run your sequenser just
to play the modules.  MIDIMATE was written partially to solve this
problem.  As  I worked on it,  I threw in some other features  you
might find useful. After v.1,  I worked on it some more,  and some 
new features can be found in MIDIMATE II:

TITLE BAR      -    Copyright message.

1-16           -    MIDI-channels.  Affects  all  commands  except
                    THRU and PANIC.

LOCAL OFF      -    Switches your master keyboard to LOCAL CONTROL
                    off. The keys are now separated from its sound
                    generators.

LOCAL ON       -    Switches LOCAL CONTROL on. 

POLY MODE ON   -    Switches POLY mode on.

MOMO MODE ON   -    Switches MONO mode on.

OMNI  MODE ON   -   Switches OMNI mode on.  The  MIDI  module  (or 
                    keyboard)  that  was set to  the  channel  you 
                    transmitted  the  message on will  now  accept 
                    MIDI-data on all channels.

OMNI MODE OFF  -    Switches OMNI mode off. MIDI will now only be 
                    recieved on the chosen channel.

TEST           -    Sends MIDI notes from C1 to C6 (in half-steps) 
                    with a velocity of 100 on the chosen  channel. 
                    Good for checking setups etc.

PANIC          -    This kills all hanging notes. I do NOT use the 
                    dedicated  ALL NOTES OFF  message  (controller 
                    123)  for  this,   as  some  modules  do   not 
                    recognize it.  Instead I send a MIDI  note-off 
                    message for all notes on all channels. This is 
                    why this command may seem a little "sluggish"! 
                    PANIC also centers the  pitch  bend-wheel  and
                    resets the modulation-wheel to zero.

PATCH  CHANGE   -   Will  send a  PROGRAM CHANGE  command  on  the 
                    current MIDI-channel. The number is determined 
                    by the input  NUMBER. MIDI uses numbers 0-127, 
                    but since most (?) keyboards use 1-128, I have 
                    given you a choice in the buttons 0-127 and 1-
                    128;  take your pick!  Since this is a feature 
                    you  probably  will  be using often, it is the 
                    default, i.e. just type the program number and 
                    return, and the program change is sent.

THRU           -    The main reason this program was born, this is 
                    really very simple,  but also very helpful  if 
                    your keyboard is connected to the ST's MIDI IN 
                    and  your modules to the MIDI OUT  port.  This 
                    setup  works ok inside your  sequenser  (using 
                    its  THRU function),  but is no good from  the 
                    desktop.  If  you click on THRU,  all is  rosy 
                    again; everything recieved at the MIDI IN port 
                    is sent to the MIDI OUT port. You can now play 
                    your  modules without running your  sequenser. 
                    Exit with any key. If you get stuck notes when 
                    exiting, use the PANIC-button! 

METRONOME       -   New in MIDIMATE II is the  METRONOME.  If this 
                    is selected,  the THRU function will provide a 
                    metronome.  There are some  options here.  You
                    can select either ATARI or MIDI.  If ATARI  is
                    selected,  the  metronome will be the standard 
                    Atari  bell-sound.  If  MIDI  is  selected,  a
                    (short,  so use a  triggered drum sound)  note 
                    will be sent out the MIDI port on an  indipen-
                    dent MIDI-channel. The channel number is typed
                    in.  If you click the  METRONOME NOTE  button,
                    you may  input the note from a MIDI  keyboard.
                    TEMPO,  obviously,  affect both.  This is also
                    typed in.

MAP MIDI CHANNEL-   Also new in MIDIMATE II, when selected MAP MIDI
                    CHANNEL  outputs  all  cannel  messages  on the 
                    chosen MIDI channel. This takes effect when you
                    use THRU.

MOD WHEEL TO VOLUME-New feature. If selected, the  modulation-wheel
                    works as a volume fader in the THRU function.

MIDI MONITOR    -   New feature.  Opens a  window and  displays all
                    incoming MIDI data.  Data is shown in  decimal,
                    hex, and binary.  A short  description of every
                    byte in plain english is also provided.  If you
                    click on the right mousebutton,  you can switch
                    a THRU function on/off. This is VERY slow,  but
                    sometimes useful anyway,  so you get to choose.
                    If the scrolling  text  moves too fast to read, 
                    you can  pause it by  clicking  the left mouse-
                    button and HOLDING it. Exit with any key.

STAY or LEAVE  -    If STAY is selected,  the only way to exit  is 
                    to click on QUIT.  If LEAVE is  selected,  you 
                    will exit after sending a command. The default 
                    is STAY. If you use MIDIMATE as a program,  do 
                    not alter this setting, or  the  program  will 
                    quit when you start using it!

QUIT           -    Exits...

MIDIMATE II  should work on any ST/Falcon in all resolutions above 
ST low,  although it  is only tested in  ST high and ST medium. It 
will work as an  accessory OR a program,  just change the extender 
to PRG/ACC! When run as an accessory, MIDIMATE II uses 44k of your 
RAM.

MIDIMATE II is now public domain.
